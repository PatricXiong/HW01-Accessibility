# HW01-Accessibility
Updating site for accessibility requirements 

Updated SEO site into semantic tags for easier access for search engines.

# Adjustments
- added semantic tags
- made sure images had alt attributes
- changing top of the page to = Header
- changing bottom of the page to = Footer
- Remove divs to main, section
- added semantic aside tag
- in aside, renamed div to section
- went into style.css to fix the appropriate semantics
- but id instead of class in "search engine optimization"
